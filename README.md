# MyNotesApp
Hello everyone!! Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸ˜ƒ

This is my NotesApp project( it's an Android Studio app using Java, with database stored using SQL Server by Microsoft).

Everything is classic, as you probably already think. The app is similar with what Google offers.

The user can add new notes to the database, of course, they can visualize, update, or delete them.

Also, to make the things more clear, I have added a demo too.
This demo consist of an MP4 video( my screen recording, and my voice trying to explain what happens there).
You can access it by downloading the archive called "NotesAppDEMO.rar".
Hope you can open the demo and enjoy it. ðŸ˜ƒ
